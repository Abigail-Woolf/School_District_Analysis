## Challenge
The grades of nineth graders at Thomas High School were incorrect and needed to be removed from the data analysis. Once that was complete, there were some changes to the results.

### How is the district summary affected?
  The district summary is affected by the absence of THS data. All of the averages and scores decreased except for the Average Reading Score, which remained the same. The biggest change, however, occurred in the % Passing Reading with a 1.3 percent change.
#### How is the school summary affected?
  The school summary dataframe is affected because all of the data from Thomas High School was removed. All of the data from the other schools remained unchanged.

Recalculate the high- and low-performing schools.
  After recalculating which schools ranked in the top five, Thomas High School was removed and Wright High School was added as the fifth school. originally, THS was ranked second, so all the schools starting at rank two moved up. 
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance, relative to the other schools? 

  Removing the math and reading scores from the nineth graders changed the THS ranking of bottom schools from 14 to 8. The removed scores of the nineth graders, brought the entire school's averages down, thus moving its rank towards the bottom of the list. 
  
Recalculate the scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type.
